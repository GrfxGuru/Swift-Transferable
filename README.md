# Swift-Transferable
This is a repository of the code created and maintained on the Compile Swift live stream for exploring the Transferable Protocol.

The macOS application has example code for accepting multiple images being dropped onto a target. They are then added to a grid display.

The user can also click a button to open the share sheet for exporting images and sharing with other people.

This work in progress and proof of concept. Not intended to be a full application in the current form. That may come later as work continues and features expand.
